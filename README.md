# OraVCS - export/import Oracle Database objects source code

## What?

You need to keep your DDLs under git and do normal development cycle over it - develop, test, deploy code on different environments. Oracle doesn't provide sufficient tooling to do this. This app is the answer.

It provides CLI to export and import entire Oracle Database schema.
